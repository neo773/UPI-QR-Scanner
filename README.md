# UPI QR Scanner

A clean, fast UPI QR scanner for iPhone that launches straight into your preferred payment app — no menus, no extra taps. Optimized for the Action Button.

## Why this exists

Paying with UPI on iPhone shouldn’t take five steps.
But it does — banking apps don’t expose their scanners, Shortcuts can’t trigger them, and WhatsApp hijacks UPI links in some regions.

This app fixes that.
Press the Action Button → scan a QR → jump directly into your UPI app’s payment screen.
No detours, no Siri, no WhatsApp Pay.

A one-press solution for something you do every day.

## What it does

* Scans any UPI QR instantly
* Opens directly in your chosen app (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, etc.)
* Bypasses WhatsApp Pay hijack
* Works perfectly with the iPhone Action Button

## Supported Apps

Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, WhatsApp Pay, Amazon Pay, CRED, MobiKwik, PayZapp, Paytm Bank, Kotak 811

## Setup

1. Build and install the app
2. Choose your preferred UPI app in Settings
